  - 2 tanks
  - 3 healers
  - Mixed DPS
  Phase 1:
  - Amber Scalpel:
    - Beam that chases player
    - Kite it
    - Leaves small damaging circles:
      - Can create "living amber" adds
      - Adds fixate on a random player
      - When they die:
        - 70k AoE damage in 8 yards
        - Heal ambers in 8 yards for 40% of their max health
        - They leave a damage puddle
  - Parasitic Growth debuff:
    - Low damage ticking
    - 30 seconds
    - If healed, the ticking amount increases
  - Reshape Life:
    - Turns a player into amber construct
    - You can be attacked by other raid members
    - Willpower bar that goes down slowly:
      - If this hits 0% you lose control and effectively die
    - You get 4 moves and an uncontrollable one:
      - Amber Strike:
        - 20% damage taken debuff (stacks)
        - Main damage
        - Interrupts casting
      - Struggle for Control:
        - Self-interrupt
        - Costs willpower
        - Increases damage you take by 100%
      - Consume Amber:
        - Consumes an amber puddle
        - Big willpower regain
        - Major healing
        - Don't need to use in first phase
      - Break free:
        - Usable with < 20% health
        - Lets you out of amber construct
      - Amber Explosion (involuntary):
        - Damage to raid
        - Interruptable by Struggle for Control
    - Amber Constructs lose 40 (of 100) willpower if they are hit by boss/adds (FAST DEATH)
      - If a tank gets hit:
        - Other tank must taunt
        - dps cleaves their health down so they can escape:
          - Optionally, wait until other tank is about to get Reshape Life to get a bigger damage debuff on boss, then dps them to low health
  Phase 2 (70%):
  - Boss is nearly immune
  - Big add Amber Monstrosity, tank add and boss separately
  - Reshape life not on tanks, but everyone else can get
  - Can use all of Phase 1 mechs
  - Amber Monstrosity:
    - Interrupt Amber Explosion with an Amber Construct's Amber Strike
  - Stomp:
    - Does AoE damage in 15 yards
    - Knockback
    - Not too bad damage-wise
  - Fling:
    - Throwing tank at random player
    - Player, tank, and people within 8 yards get stunned and take damage
  Phase 3:
  - No Amber Scalpel
  - More Reshape Life
  - Buff on boss: 50% more damage and attack speed (keep this in mind healers)
  - Lots of pools:
    - Bad for players
    - Good for Amber Constructs
  - Be very wary of your willpower
  Generic fight-wide notes:
  - Don't consume amber puddles in phase 1 or 2; they will be needed in phase 3. Just spam your amber strike on the boss to stack the debuff on him, the raid needs to cleave your health down (carefully or you will be taking an amber nap). When you get to < 20% health, break free.
  - If you got amber scalpel, please get away from the raid in a timely manner. We don't want to be stepping in your puddles and the healers won't be happy.
  - Please interrupt all the things with amber strike. When the amber monstrosity is about to do his keep amber strike off CD. Also, if it's a choice between stopping your explosion and stopping the monstrosity's explosion, keep in mind that larger things tend to do more damage than smaller (so stopping the add's over yours is better).
  - Stay 8 yards apart. Keep adds spaced 8 yards apart. Keep add puddles away from the raid (but not so far that constructs can't get to them easily). There will be less damage and stunning to the raid, and less healing for the adds. Also, it decreases amber puddle density, so it's easier to not step in them.
  - Tanks, remember to taunt when the other tank is becoming amber-ified, or you lose that other tank quickly. Also get out of the amber construct so you don't get 2 ambered tanks that either can't tank or die in 2-3 melee hits from the boss/adds.
